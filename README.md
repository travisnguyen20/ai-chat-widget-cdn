# Project Name

## Description

This project aims to serve build files via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/). jsDelivr is a global content delivery network (CDN) that allows you to host and deliver your project's static files, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images.

## Usage

To serve your build files via jsDelivr, follow these steps:

1. Upload your build files to a public repository or hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or a web server).
2. Obtain the URL of your build files.
3. Use the following format to access your build files via jsDelivr:

    ```
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/travisnguyen20/breads-widget@main/breads-widget.js
    ```

    Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username or the username of the repository hosting your build files. Replace `<repository>` with the name of your repository. Replace `<path-to-build-file>` with the path to your build file within the repository.

4. You can now use the generated URL to serve your build files via jsDelivr.
